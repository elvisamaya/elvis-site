    As a part of the Networked Systems Lab in USC's Viterbi School of Engineering, I collaborated with a professor and a Ph.D. student to explore the intersection of technology, history, and education. By utilizing a game engine called Unity, an Oculus virtual reality headset, and a computer, I was able to construct historical scenes within virtual reality. Upon completion, teachers, students, and children could immerse themselves in the history of the U.S., visualizing early British colonization of the New World, the American Revolution, and the present-day U.S. through depictions of the White House. However, the effectiveness of the project was not logistically measured during my time at SHINE. The project was created, but the assessment of its performance through application was still necessary to determine its significance.

    This project features an Arduino Uno board along with various electronic components to power the feeder system. It uses a motion sensor to detect an animal’s presence and activates a motor that releases food. This ensures that hungry animals can easily access nourishment when needed. By providing a reliable food source, the feeder aims to reduce the risk of species decline and support the balance of ecosystems.

    In this project, I designed and built a solar-powered USB charger capable of charging small electronic devices such as cellphones, iPods, and tablets. The system uses a solar panel to capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy, which is then stored in a rechargeable lithium-polymer (LiPo) battery. Because USB devices require a constant 5 V output and the LiPo battery provides only about 3.7 V, the project also integrates a DC–DC voltage converter to step up the voltage to the required 5 V.

      I conducted an in-depth analysis of Twitter’s stock to evaluate whether it represented a buy or sell opportunity. The analysis began by examining the industries Twitter operates in, along with the core services it provides and how those services generate revenue. I then explored Twitter’s customer base and competitive landscape, highlighting how major rivals such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok influence its market position.

The financial section focused on Twitter’s revenue and profits during the 2020 fiscal year, with particular attention to its operating profit and overall profitability. I also reviewed historical stock prices and dividend activity to understand how investors have responded to Twitter’s performance. By combining market insights with financial data, the presentation offered a clear picture of Twitter’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, ultimately addressing whether the stock should be considered a buy or sell.
